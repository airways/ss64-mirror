<p><b>Examples (SQL*Plus):</b></p>
<p>View the definition of <i>myview:</i></p>
<p class="code">set LONG 1000<br>
select TEXT from ALL_VIEWS <br>
where owner='<i>myowner</i>' and view_name='<i>myview</i>';</p>
<p>1000 should be more than large enough to read most view definitions, but if you want to set this exactly look at the TEXT_LENGTH column:</p>
<p class="code">select TEXT_LENGTH from ALL_VIEWS <br>
where view_name = '<i>myview</i>';</p>
