</head><body><h1>hash</h1> 
<p>Remember the full pathnames of commands specified as name arguments, 
so they need not be searched for on subsequent invocations.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      hash [-r] [-p <i>filename</i>] [<i>name</i>] 

Options
      -r   Reset, causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.

      -p   Use <i>filename</i> as the location of <i>name</i> (don't search $PATH).</pre>
<p> The commands are found by searching through the directories listed in $PATH. 
  <br>
  <br>
  If no arguments are given, information about remembered commands is printed. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The return status is zero unless a name is not found or an invalid option is 
  supplied. </p>
<p>hash is a bash built in command.<br>
