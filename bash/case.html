<p>Conditionally perform a command, <code>case</code> will selectively execute 
  the <var>command-list</var> corresponding to the first <var>pattern</var> that 
  matches <var>word</var>. <br>
</p>
<pre>Syntax 
      case <var>word</var> in [ [(] <var>pattern</var> [| <var>pattern</var>]...) <var>command-list</var> ;;]... esac</pre>
<span class="body">The <samp>`|'</samp> is used to separate multiple patterns, 
and the <samp>`)'</samp> operator terminates a pattern list. A list of patterns 
and an associated command-list is known as a <var>clause</var>. Each clause must 
be terminated with <samp>`;;'</samp>. <br>
<br>
The <var>word</var> undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, 
arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before matching is attempted. Each <var>pattern</var> 
undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic 
expansion. There can be an arbitrary number of <code>case</code> clauses, each 
terminated by a <samp>`;;'</samp>. The first pattern that matches determines the 
command-list that is executed. <br>
<br>
Here is an example using <code>case</code> in a script that could be used to describe 
one interesting feature of an animal: </span> 
<pre>echo -n "Enter the name of an animal: "
read ANIMAL
echo -n "The $ANIMAL has "
case $ANIMAL in
  horse | dog | cat) echo -n "four";;
  man | kangaroo ) echo -n "two";;
  *) echo -n "an unknown number of";;
esac
echo " legs."</pre>
<p>The return status is zero if no <var>pattern</var> is matched. 
Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the <var>command-list</var> 
executed. </p>
