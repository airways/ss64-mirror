<p>Do nothing, returning a zero (true) exit status</p>
<pre>Syntax:
      true
</pre>
<p> `true' does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning "success".  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a 
successful command is needed, although the shell built-in command <span class="code">: </span>(colon) does the same thing faster.<br>
<br>
`true' ignores <b>all</b> command line arguments, even <span class="code">--help</span> and <span class="code">--version</span>, since to do otherwise would change expected behavior that
some programmers may be relying on.<br>
<br>
This version of `true' is implemented as a C program, and is thus
more secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and may
safely be used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.</p>
