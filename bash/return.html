<p>Cause a shell function to exit with the return value n. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      return [<i>n</i>]  

Options
      <i>n</i>    Return value i.e. an errorlevel</pre>
<p> If n is not supplied, the return value is the exit status of the last command executed in the function. This can also be used to terminate execution of a script being executed with the . (or source) builtin, returning either n or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script. <br>
<br>
The return status is false if return is used outside a function and not during the execution of a script by . or source. </p>
<p>return is a bash builtin command.</p>
