</head><body><h1>umask</h1> 
<p><span class="body">User's file creation mask</span>. umask sets an environment variable which automatically sets file permissions on newly created files. i.e. it will set the shell process's 
file creation mask to <var>mode</var>.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      umask [-p] [-S] [<var>mode</var>]

Key
   mode  File creation mask

   -S    Print the mask in symbolic format

   -p    Output in a form that can be reused as input</pre>
<p> The mode specified works as a mask, if <var>mode</var> is omitted, the current value of the mask will be printed.</p>
<p>You can set umask in <span class="code"><a href="syntax-bashrc.html">/etc/bashrc</a></span> or <span class="code">/etc/profile</span> for all users. By default most Linux distros will set it to 0022 (022) or 0002 (002).</p>
<p>So the file will contain<br>
<span class="code">umask 022</span></p>
<p>If <var>mode</var> begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; if not, it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by the <a href="chmod.html">chmod</a> command. <br>
<br>The return status is zero if the mode is successfully changed or if no <var>mode</var> argument is supplied, and non-zero otherwise. <br>
<br>Note that when the <i>mode</i> is interpreted as an octal number, each number of the umask is subtracted from <code>7</code>. Thus, a umask of <code>022</code> results in permissions of <code>755</code>. </p>
<p>umask is a bash built in command.<br>
