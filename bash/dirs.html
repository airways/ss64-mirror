<p>Display the list of currently remembered directories. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      dirs [+N | -N] [-clpv]

Options
     +N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the left of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero. 

     -N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the right of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero.  

     -c   Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the elements. 

     -l   Produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote 
          the home directory.

     -p   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line. 
     -v   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.</pre>
