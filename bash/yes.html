<pre>Syntax
      yes <i>text</i>
      yes --help
      yes --version

   text       The text to repeat

<p>yes in conjunction with <a href="head.html" title="Head (Unix)">head</a> can be used to generate large  test files. For example, executing</p>
<p class="code">yes 123456789 | head -1000 &gt; file.txt</p>
<p>results in a file with 1000 lines each consisting of 10 characters (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and newline).</p>
<p>Using yes results in 100% processor usage, for this reason it is rarely used other than for testing e.g. to max out a computer's CPU.</p>
