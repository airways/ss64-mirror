<p>Do nothing, returning a non-zero (false) exit status.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      false</pre>
<p>  `false' does nothing except return an exit status of 1, meaning 
  "failure".  It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where an
  unsuccessful command is needed.<br>
  <br>
  `false' ignores <b>all</b> command line arguments, even <span class="code">--help</span> and  <span class="code">--version</span>, since to do otherwise would change expected behavior that 
some programmers might be relying on.</p>
<p>  This version of `false' is implemented as a C program, and is thus 
  more secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and can 
  safely be used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.</p>
