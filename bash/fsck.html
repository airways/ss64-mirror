<pre>Syntax
      fsck [<i>options</i>] [<i>filesystem</i>] ...

Options

         All options that fsck doesn't recognize will also be passed.

  -r     Interactive mode; prompt before making any repairs.

  -s     Serial mode.

</i>         Specify the filesystem type. Do not check filesystems of any other type.

  -A     Check all filesystems listed in /etc/fstab.
