</head><body><h1>tee</h1> 
<p>Redirect output to multiple files, copies standard input to standard 
  output and also to any files given as arguments. This is useful when you want 
not only to send some data down a pipe, but also to save a copy.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      tee [<i>options</i>]... [<i>file</i>]...

Options
   -a
   --append
        Append standard input to the given files rather than overwriting
        them.

   -i
   --ignore-interrupts'
        Ignore interrupt signals.

Example:

   ps -ax | tee processes.txt | more</pre>
<p>If a file being written to does not already exist, it is created. 
  <br>
  If a file being written to already exists, the data it previously contained 
  is overwritten unless the `-a' option is used.<br>
