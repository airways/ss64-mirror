<p>Run a command with modified scheduling priority, print or modify 
the scheduling priority of a job.</p>
<pre>SYNTAX
      nice [<i>Option</i>]... [<i>Command</i> [<i>Arg</i>]...]

OPTION
      -n <i>MyADJUSTMENT</i>
      -<i>MyADJUSTMENT</i>
      --adjustment=<i>MyADJUSTMENT</i>

 Priority can be adjusted by `nice' over the range
  of -20 (the highest priority) 
  to 19 (the lowest)</pre>
<p> If no arguments are given, `nice' prints the current scheduling 
  priority, which it inherited. </p>
<p>Otherwise, `nice' runs the given <i>Command</i> with its scheduling 
  priority adjusted. <br>
  <br>
  If no option for <i>MyADJUSTMENT</i> is given, the priority of the command is 
  incremented by 10. You must have appropriate privileges to specify a negative 
  adjustment. <br>
  <br>
  Because most shells have a built-in command by the same name, using the unadorned 
  command name in a script or interactively can get you different functionality 
  than that described here.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Run an echo command with low priority:<br>
<span class="code">sudo nice -n 10 echo Hello</span></p>
<p>Run an echo command with high priority:<br>
<span class="code">sudo nice -n -10 echo Hello</span><br>
