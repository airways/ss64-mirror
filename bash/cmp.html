</head><body><h1>cmp</h1> 
<p>Compare two files, and if they differ, tells the first byte and 
  line number where they differ.<br>
  <br>
  You can use the `cmp' command to show the offsets and line numbers where two 
  files differ. `cmp' can also show all the characters that differ between the 
two files, side by side.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      cmp <i>options</i>... <i>FromFile</i> [<i>ToFile</i>]

Options
      Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument)
      can be combined into a single command line word: 
      so `-cl' is equivalent to -c -l.

-c
     Print the differing characters.  Display control characters as a
     `^' followed by a letter of the alphabet and precede characters
     that have the high bit set with `M-' (which stands for "meta").

--ignore-initial=<i>BYTES</i>
     Ignore any differences in the the first <i>BYTES</i> bytes of the input
     files.  Treat files with fewer than <i>BYTES</i> bytes as if they are
     empty.

-l
     Print the (decimal) offsets and (octal) values of all differing
     bytes.

--print-chars
     Print the differing characters.  Display control characters as a
     `^' followed by a letter of the alphabet and precede characters
     that have the high bit set with `M-' (which stands for "meta").

--quiet
-s
--silent
     Do not print anything; only return an exit status indicating
     whether the files differ.

--verbose
     Print the (decimal) offsets and (octal) values of all differing
     bytes.

-v
--version
     Output the version number of `cmp'.

      The file name `-' is always the standard input.  `cmp' also uses the
      standard input if one file name is omitted.

      An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
      differences were found, and 2 means trouble.</pre>

  <b>Example</b></p>
<p class="code">$ cmp tnsnames.ora tnsnames.old</p>
<p><b>Notes</b><br>
  `cmp' reports the differences between two files character by character, instead 
  of line by line. As a result, it is more useful than `diff' for comparing binary 
  files. For text files, `cmp' is useful mainly when you want to know only whether 
  two files are identical. <br>
  <br>
  For files that are identical, `cmp' produces no output. When the files differ, 
  by default, `cmp' outputs the byte offset and line number where the first difference 
  occurs. You can use the `-s' option to suppress that information, so that `cmp' 
  produces no output and reports whether the files differ using only its exit 
  status. <br>
  Unlike `diff', `cmp' cannot compare directories; it can only compare two files.<br>
