<p>A login shell,  is your topmost shell, and is started when

<p>Sub-Shells</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A
      `sub-shell' is a shell created after login, either by loading a new shell or opening a window with a graphics interface. A sub-shell usually will not
    accept the command `logout' to terminate, you must use `exit' or ^D.<br>
  When you terminate a sub-shell, you are returned to the process or shell
that created it. </p>

<p><b>Example</b> (starting from a bash shell) </p>
<p><span class="code">$ tcsh<br>
  % # now in the tcsh shell <br>
  % exit<br>
  $ 
  # now back in the bash shell <br>
  $ logout
  </span><br>
