<p>Display any lines in file which contain <i>string</i> as a prefix. </p>
<pre>Syntax
      look [-df] [-t <i>termchar</i>] <i>string</i> [<i>file</i>]

 As look performs a binary search, the lines in <i>file</i> must be sorted.

Options:

 -d   Dictionary character set and order, i.e. only alphanumeric characters are compared.

 -f   Ignore the case of alphabetic characters (UPPER/lower).

 -t   Specify a string termination character, i.e. only the characters
      in <i>string </i>up to and including the first occurrence of <i>termchar</i> are compared.
</pre>
<p> If <i>file</i> is not specified, the dictionary file <span class="code">/usr/share/dict/words</span> is used, only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic characters is ignored.</p>
<p>Exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed, 1 if no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.</p>
<p>The return status is the exit status of the last command executed 
in <var>consequent-commands</var>, or zero if none were executed. </p>
