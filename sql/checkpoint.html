<title>CHECKPOINT | SQL Server | SS64.com</title>
</head><body><h1>CHECKPOINT</h1>
<p>Write all dirty pages to disk.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      CHECKPOINT [<i>duration</i>]

Key<i>
   </i><i>duration</i>    Time for the checkpoint to complete (seconds).</pre>
<p>     CHECKPOINT will write to disk all  those data pages  in the buffer cache of the current database which have been modified, but not yet written to disk. </p>
<p>Issuing SHUTDOWN WITH NOWAIT or directly stopping the msSqlServer service from the Windows control panel will <b>not </b>perform a checkpoint. When the database is restarted, this will force a rollback operation to occur for any uncompleted transactions. </p>
<p>Example</p>

  measure designed to prevent terrorists from transporting bombs. It is
