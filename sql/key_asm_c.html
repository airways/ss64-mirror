</head><body><h1>CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY</h1>
<p>Create an asymmetric key in the database.</p>
<pre>Syntax:
   CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY <i>Asym_Key_Name</i> 
      [AUTHORIZATION <i>database_principal_name</i>]
         FROM &lt;<i>Asym_Key_Source</i>&gt;
            [ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<i>password</i>']

   CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY <i>Asym_Key_Name</i> 
      [AUTHORIZATION <i>database_principal_name</i>]
         WITH ALGORITHM = { RSA_512 | RSA_1024 | RSA_2048 }
            [ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<i>password</i>'] 
Key:

   Asym_Key_Source: The source from which to load the asymmetric key pair:
      FILE = '<i>path_to_strong-name_file</i>'
      EXECUTABLE FILE = '<i>path_to_executable_file</i>'
      ASSEMBLY <i>Assembly_Name</i>

   database_principal_name
           The owner of the asymmetric key. The owner cannot be a role or a group.
           default = current user.

   'path_to_strong-name_file'
           Path of a strong-name file from which to load the key pair. 

   'path_to_executable_file'
          An assembly file from which to load the public key.

   Assembly_Name
          Name of an assembly from which to load the public key.

   'password'
          Password with which to encrypt the private key.
          default = encrypt using the database master key.
</pre>
<p>
  

An asymmetric key is a secured at the database level. In its default form, this entity contains both a public key and a private key. The private key can be 512, 1024, or 2048 bits long. </p>
<p>Without the FROM clause, CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY generates a <b>new</b> key pair. <br>
  With the FROM clause, CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY <b>imports</b> a key pair from a file or imports a public key from an assembly.</p>
<p>If no database master key has been created, a password is required to protect the private key. <br>
Requires CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY permission on the database.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<pre>CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY MyKey01 
  WITH ALGORITHM = RSA_2048 
  ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'fmsA$ek7i82bv64fobjsd2764'; 
GO


CREATE ASYMMETRIC KEY MyKey02 AUTHORIZATION JDoe 
  FROM FILE = ' c:\Certs\JDoe.tmp' 
  ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '35agRofg0sjlkfssJ454GX72$262';
GO </pre>
