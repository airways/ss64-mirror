<pre>Syntax:
      OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY <i>Key</i> DECRYPTION BY <i>decrypt_option</i>
<i>
decrypt_options</i>:
   CERTIFICATE <i>certificate</i> [WITH PASSWORD = '<i>password</i>']
   ASYMMETRIC KEY <i>asym_key</i> [WITH PASSWORD = '<i>password</i>']
   SYMMETRIC KEY <i>decrypting_Key</i>
   PASSWORD = '<i>decryption_password</i>'

Key:
   certificate   Certificate whose private key will be used to decrypt the symmetric key.
   asym_key      An asymmetric key whose private key will be used to decrypt the symmetric key.
   password    Password that was used to encrypt the private key of the certificate or asymmetric key.
   decrypting_key  Key that will be used to decrypt the key being opened.
