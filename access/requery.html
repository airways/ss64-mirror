<p> Requery the data in a form or a control.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      DoCmd.Requery(<i>ControlName</i>)

      <i>Form</i>.Requery

Key
   <i>ControlName</i>  The name of a control to requery.

   <i>Form</i>         The name of a form to requery.</pre>
<p> The <span class="code">Requery</span> method will update the data underlying a form or control to reflect new/ deleted records since last queried.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">RefreshRecord</span> method will update the current records to reflect  changes. If a row in the record source has been deleted, it will change to show <span class="code">#Deleted</span>. </p>
<p>The <span class="code"><i>form</i>.Repaint</span> method simply repaints the specified form and its controls.</p>
<p>The Requery method in Visual Basic is faster than the Requery action or the DoCmd.Requery method. </p>

<p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;My mother made me a scientist without ever intending to. Every other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school: So? Did you learn anything today? But not my mother. &ldquo;Izzy&rdquo;, she would say, &ldquo;did you ask a good question today?&rdquo; That difference &ndash; asking good questions &ndash; made me become a scientist&rdquo; ~ Isidor Isaac Rabi</i></p>
