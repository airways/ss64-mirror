<p> Enlarge the active window, the current Access form or report.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      DoCmd.Maximise</pre>
<p>When an Access window is maximized, all other windows will also be maximized when you open them or switch to them.</p>
<p>The size of an Access Window will be constrained by the size of the window containing the MS Access application, <i>unless</i> the form is a popup form, in which case it can be moved outside the main window.</p>
<p>Pop-up forms are never maximized. To format a form as a PopUp, set the forms PopUp property to True.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p class="code">DoCmd.Maximise</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not here to leave a mark, bro. Monuments, legacies, marks - that&rsquo;s where we always go wrong. We&rsquo;re here to revel in the world, to soak in the awesomeness of it, to enjoy the ride. The world&rsquo;s maximum perfect as it is, beauty from horizon to horizon. Any mark any of us tries to leave - hell, it&rsquo;s only graffitti. Any mark anyone leaves is no better than vandalism&rdquo; ~&nbsp;Dean Koontz</p>
