<p>Display lines beginning with a given string. As look performs a
binary search, the lines in <i>file</i> must be sorted.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      look [-df] [-t <i>termchar</i>] <i>string</i> [<i>file</i> ...]

Options:

     -d      Dictionary character set and order,
             i.e., only alphanumeric characters are compared.

     -f      Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.

     -t      Specify a string termination character,
             i.e., only the characters in <i>string</i> up to and including
             the first occurrence of <i>termchar</i> are compared.

If <i>file</i> is not specified, the file /usr/share/dict/words is used, only alphanumeric
characters are compared and the case of alphabetic characters is ignored.</pre>
<p>ENVIRONMENT<br>
The LANG, LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE environment variables affect the execution of the look utility.  Their
     effect is described in environ(7).</p>
<p>FILES<br>
<span class="code">&nbsp;/usr/share/dict/words</span> the dictionary</p>
<p>EXIT STATUS<br>

  >1 if an error occurred.</p>

with LC_COLLATE set to `C'.</p>
