<pre>Syntax

     more [-dlfpcsu] [-num] [+/ <i>pattern</i>] [+ <i>linenum</i>] [<i>file</i> ...]

Options
     -num  This option specifies an integer which is the screen size (in
           lines).

     -d    more will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to continue,
           'q' to quit.]" and will display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]"
           instead of ringing the bell when an illegal key is pressed.

     -l    more usually treats ^L (form feed) as a special character, and will
           pause after any line that contains a form feed.  The -l option will
           prevent this behavior.

     -f    Causes more to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long
           lines are not folded).

     -p    Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display
           the text.

     -c    Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing
           the remainder of each line as it is displayed.

     -s    Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.

     -u    Suppress underlining.

     +/    The +/ option specifies a string that will be searched for before
           each file is displayed.

     +num  Start at line number num.</pre>
<p> The -n and -v options are non-standard and their use in scripts 
  is not recommended. </P>
<p>When the output of <span class="code">more</span> is redirected to a file, it outputs a small header for each file:<br>
<span class="code">:::::::::::::: filename.txt ::::::::::::::</span></P>
