<p>Examples</p>
<p class="code">$ uname -m<br>

<p class="code">$ uname -v<br>
Darwin Kernel Version 9.8.0: Wed Jul 15 16:55:01 PDT 2009; root:xnu-1228.15.4~1/RELEASE_I386</p>
<p>The version data includes either <span class="code">i386</span> or <span class="code">X86_64</span> indicating a 32 or 64 bit kernel. A 32-bit kernel is the default on most Apple computers, and this will still run 64-bit applications under Snow Leopard. Unless you are doing kernel/system-level development there is no need or benefit to running a 64-bit kernel.</p>
<p>During system boot you can hold down '6' and '4' to load the 64 bit kernel or hold down '3' and '2' to use the 32 bit kernel.<br> 
Your machine will default into the kernel that is best supported.</p>
