<p><span class="body">Each case label is successively matched, against the specified 
  <i>string</i> which is first command and filename expanded. </span></p>
<p><span class="body">The file metacharacters `*', `?' and `[...]' may be used 
  in the case labels, which are variable expanded. </span></p>
<p><span class="body">If none of the labels match before a `default' label is 
  found, then the execution begins after the default label. </span></p>
<p><span class="body">Each case label and the default label must appear at the 
  beginning of a line. The command breaksw causes execution to continue after 
  the endsw. Otherwise control may fall through case labels and default labels 
  as in C. </span></p>
<p><span class="body">If no label matches and there is no default, execution continues 
  after the endsw.</span> <span class="body"><br>
