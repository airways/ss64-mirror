<p>Exit a function with the return value specified by <i>n</i>.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      return [<i>n</i>]

Key
   <i>n</i>   The value to return</pre>
<p>If <i>n</i> is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed in the function body. </p>
<p>If used outside a function, but during execution of a script by the . (source) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return either <i>n</i> or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script. </p>

<p>Any command associated with the RETURN trap is executed before execution resumes after the function or script.</p>
<p>return is a bash builtin command.</p>
