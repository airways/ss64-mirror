<p>Unbind a job from the current login session. Each <i>jobspec</i> is removed from the table of active jobs.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      disown [-ar] [-h] [<i>jobspec</i> ...]<br>
Key<br>   -h   Each <i>jobspec </i>is not removed from the table, but is marked so that SIGHUP is not
        sent to the job if the shell receives a SIGHUP.
<br>   -r   Without a <i>jobspec</i> argument, will restrict operation to running jobs.
<br>   -a   Without a <i>jobspec</i> argument, will remove or mark all jobs

 jobspec The job ID of a background job</pre>
<p> If no <i>jobspec</i> is present, and neither the -a nor the  -r option is supplied, the current job is used.</p>
<p>The return value is 0 unless a <i>jobspec</i> does not specify a valid job.</p>
<p>disown is a bash built in command.</p>
