<p>NTFS file system utility, supports the mounting, probing, and unmounting of
NTFS file systems.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      ntfs.util -k <i>device</i>

      ntfs.util -m <i>device mountpoint mountflag1 mountflag2 mountflag3 mountflag4
</i>
      ntfs.util -p <i>device mountflag1 mountflag2</i>

      ntfs.util -u <i>device mountpoint</i>

Key
    -k   Get the UUID key for the NTFS file system at <i>device</i>.

    -m   Mount the NTFS file system located on device onto
         mountpoint with the flags mountflag1 mountflag2
         mountflag3 mountflag4.

    -p   Probe the device for an NTFS file system using the
         flags mountflag1 mountflag2.  If the probe is successful
         i.e. the device contains a valid NTFS file system,
         its label is printed to the standard output stream.

    -u   Unmount the NTFS file system located at device and
         mounted on mountpoint.

The mountflags referenced above are:
    •   mountflag1: removable or fixed

    •   mountflag3: suid or nosuid
    •   mountflag4: dev or nodev</pre>
