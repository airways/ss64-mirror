</head><body><h1>trap</h1> 
<p>Execute a command when the shell receives a signal.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      trap [-lp] [[<i>arg</i>] <i>sigspec</i> ...]

Key
   -p   Display signal commands (or trap commands for <i>sigspec</i>)

   -l   Print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers.

   arg  The command to be executed when the shell receives signal(s) <i>sigspec</i>.
</pre>
<p>  If <span class="code"><i>arg</i></span> is absent (and there is a single sigspec) or -, each specified signal is reset to its original
disposition (the value it had upon entrance to the shell). </p>
<p>If <span class="code"><i>arg</i></span> is the null string the signal specified by each <i>sigspec</i> is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.</p>
<p> If <span class="code"><i>arg</i></span> is not present and -p has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each <i>sigspec</i> are displayed. If no arguments are supplied or if only -p is given, trap prints the list of 
commands associated with each signal. </p>
<p>Each sigspec is either a signal name defined in &lt;signal.h&gt;, or a signal number. Signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional. </p>
<p>If a <i>sigspec </i>is EXIT (0) the command <span class="code"><i>arg</i></span> is executed on exit from the shell. <br>
If a
<i>sigspec</i> is DEBUG, the command <span class="code"><i>arg</i></span> is executed before every simple command, for command, case command, select command, every arithmetic for command, and before the first command executes
in a shell function (see SHELL GRAMMAR). Refer to the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin for details of its effect on the DEBUG trap. </p>
<p>If a sigspec is ERR,
the command <span class="code"><i>arg</i></span> is executed whenever a simple command has a non-zero exit status, subject to the following conditions. The ERR trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the
command list immediately following a <a href="while.html">while</a> or until keyword, part of the test in an if statement, part of a &amp;&amp; or || list, or if the command's return value is being inverted via !.<br>
These are the same conditions obeyed by the errexit option. </p>
<p>If a sigspec is RETURN, the command <span class="code"><i>arg</i></span> is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source 
builtins finishes executing. </p>
<p>Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset. Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset to their original values in a<br>
child process when it is created. </p>
<p>The return status is false if any sigspec is invalid; otherwise trap returns true.</p>
<p>trap is a bash built in command.</p>
