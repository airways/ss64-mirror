</head><body><h1>sleep</h1> 
<p>Delay for a specified time.<br>
  Suspends execution for a minimum of <i>seconds. </i>Sleep is usually used to schedule 
the execution of other commands.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      sleep <i>seconds</i>

Examples

   To schedule the execution of a command for x number seconds later:

         (sleep 1800; sh command_file >& errors)&

   This incantation would wait a half hour before running the script command_file.

   To reiteratively run a command (with the csh(1)):

         while (1)
                 if (! -r zzz.rawdata) then
                         sleep 300
                 else
                         foreach i (`ls *.rawdata`)
                                 sleep 70
                                 awk -f collapse_data $i >> results
                         end
                         break
                 endif
         end
</pre>
<p>The scenario for a script such as this might be: a program currently running is taking longer than expected to process a series of files, and it
would be nice to have another program start processing the files created
by the first program as soon as it is finished (when <span class="code">zzz.rawdata</span> is created).  </p>
<p>The script checks every five minutes for the file <span class="code">zzz.rawdata</span>,
when the file is found, then another portion processing is done courteously by sleeping for 70 seconds in between each awk job.</p>
<p>Exits with 0 on successful completion, or if the signal SIGALRM 
  was received. <br>
  exits with >0 if an error occurred.</p>
