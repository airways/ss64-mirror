<p class="quote"><i>"The general attitude seems to be that people should wear square shoes, because squares are easier to design and manufacture than foot shaped shoes. If the shoe industry has gone the way of the computer industry it would now be running a $200-a-day course on how to walk, run and jump in square shoes" ~ Alan Kay</i></p>
