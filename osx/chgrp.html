</head><body><h1>chgrp</h1> 
<p>Change group ownership (update the group ID of files.)</p>
<pre>Syntax 
      chgrp [-fhv] [-R [-H | -L | -P]] <i>group file</i> ...

The <i>group</i> operand can be either a group name, or a numeric group ID.

Options

   -R     Recurse: Change the mode of file hierarchies rooted in the files
          instead of just the files themselves.

   -R -H  Follow symbolic links on the command line
          (by default Symbolic links within the tree are not followed.)    

   -R -L  All symbolic links are followed.

   -R -P  No symbolic links are followed. (default)

   -f     Force, ignores errors, except for usage errors and doesn't query
          about strange modes (unless the user lacks permissions).

   -h     If the file is a symbolic link, the group ID of the link itself
          is changed rather than the file that is pointed to.

   -v     Verbose, show filenames as the group is modified.</pre>
<p>The user invoking chgrp must belong to the specified 
group and be the owner of the file, or be the super-user.<br></p>
<p> The chgrp utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error 
occurs.</p>
<p>In previous versions of this system, symbolic links did not have groups.<br>
The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is 
not recommended.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b><br>
<br>
Assign Ursula as the owner of "MyFile.txt" file in the Shared directory. </p>
<p class="code">sudo chown Ursula /Users/Shared/MyFile.txt </p>
<p>Assign Ursula as the owner, and staff as the group for everything in the "tmp" 
folder</p>
<p class="code">sudo chown -R Ursula:staff /Users/Shared/tmp/ </p>
