</head><h1>Conditional Execution</h1>
<pre>An AND list has the form </pre>
<pre><var>      command1</var> &amp;&amp; <var>command2</var></pre>
<pre><var>command2</var> is executed if, and only if, <var>command1</var> succeeds
</pre>
<pre>An OR list has the form </pre>
<pre><var>      command1</var> || <var>command2</var></pre>
<pre><var>command2</var> is executed if, and only if, <var>command1</var> fails  </pre>
<p>A <code>list</code> is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one 
  of the operators <samp>`;'</samp>, <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, <samp>`&amp;&amp;'</samp>, 
  or <samp>`||'</samp>, and optionally terminated by one of <samp>`;'</samp>, 
  <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, or a <code>newline</code>. </p>
<p>Of these list operators, <samp>`&amp;&amp;'</samp> and <samp>`||'</samp> have 
  equal precedence, followed by <samp>`;'</samp> and <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, which 
  have equal precedence. </p>
<p>If a command is terminated by the control operator <samp>`&amp;'</samp>, the 
  shell executes the command asynchronously in a subshell. This is known as executing 
  the command in the <var>background</var>. The shell does not wait for the command 
  to finish, and the return status is 0 (true).</p>
