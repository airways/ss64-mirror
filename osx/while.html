<p>Execute commands</p>
<pre>Syntax
      while <i>list</i>; do <i>list</i>; done
<br>      until <i>list</i>; do <i>list</i>; done</pre>
<p>The <span class="code">while</span> command continuously executes the do <i>list</i> as long as the last command in <i>list</i> returns an exit status of zero. </p>
<p>The <span class="code">until</span> command is identical to the while command, except
that the test is negated; the do <i>list</i> is executed as long as the last command in <i>list</i> returns a non-zero exit status. </p>
<p>The exit status of the while and until commands is the exit status of the last do list command executed, or zero if none was executed.</p>
