</head><body><h1>builtin</h1> 
<p>Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it arguments, and return its exit status.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      builtin <i>shell-builtin</i> [<i>arguments</i>]</pre>
<p>This
is  useful  when  defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the
functionality of the builtin within the function.  The cd builtin is commonly  redefined  this
way.  </p>
<p>The return status is false if shell-builtin is not a shell builtin command.</p>
<p> <b>Example</b></p>
<pre>$ builtin ls</pre>
<p> builtin is a builtin command</p>
