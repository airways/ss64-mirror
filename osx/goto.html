<pre>Syntax 
       goto <i>word</i>

  <i>word</i> is filename and command-substituted to yield a  string  of
  the  form `label'.  The shell rewinds its input as much as possible,
  searches for a line of the form `label:', possibly  preceded  by 
  blanks  or  tabs, and continues execution after that line.</pre>
