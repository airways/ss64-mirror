<p>Loop command.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      for <var>name</var> [in <var>words</var> ...]; do <var>commands</var>; done</pre>
<p>Expand <var>words</var>, and execute <var>commands</var> once for each member in the resultant list, with <var>name</var> bound to the current member.</p>
<p>When a wildcard is introduced, then words will match against filenames, * will match every file in the directory.</p>
<pre>for thisfile in *; do
   echo &quot;found $thisfile&quot;
done</pre>
<p>If <samp>`in <var>words</var>'</samp> is not present, the <code>for</code> command executes the <var>commands</var> once for each positional parameter that is set, as if <samp>`in "$@"'</samp> had been specified (see section <a 
  href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashref.html#SEC25">Special Parameters</a>). The return status is the exit status of the last command that executes. If there are no items in the expansion of <var>words</var>, no commands are executed, and the return status is zero. An alternate form of the <code>for</code> command is also supported: </p>
<pre>for (( <var>expr1</var> ; <var>expr2</var> ; <var>expr3</var> )) ; do <var>commands</var> ; done</pre>
<p>First, the arithmetic expression <var>expr1</var> is evaluated according to the rules described below . The arithmetic expression <var>expr2</var> is then evaluated repeatedly until it evaluates to zero. <br>
    <br>
  Each time <var>expr2</var> evaluates to a non-zero value, <var>commands</var> are executed and the arithmetic expression <var>expr3</var> is evaluated. If any expression is omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1. <br>
    <br>
  The return value is the exit status of the last command in <var>list</var> that is executed, or false if any of the expressions is invalid. </p>
<p>for is a bash builtin command </p>
