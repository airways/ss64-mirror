</head><body><h1>umask</h1> 
<p><span class="body">User's file creation mask</span>. Set the shell process's 
file creation mask to <var>mode</var>.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      umask [-p] [-S] [<var>mode</var>]

Key
   mode  File creation mask
   -S    Print the mask in symbolic format (the default is an octal number)
   -p    Output in a form that may be reused as input (if <i>mode </i>is omitted)</pre>
<p> The current value of the mask will be printed if <var>mode</var> is omitted. By default OS X will set it to 0022 (022)</p>
<p> If mode begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by <a href="chmod.html">chmod</a>. </p>
<p> Note that when the <i>mode</i> is interpreted as an octal number, each number of the umask is subtracted from <code>7</code>. Thus, a umask of <code>022</code> results in permissions of <code>755</code>. </p>
<p>The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no <i>mode</i> argument was supplied, and false otherwise.</p>
<p> <b>Examples<br>
  </b>Example values for the mask:<br>
  022, gives read and execute access to the group and others.<br>
  <br>
  The return status is zero if the mode is successfully changed or if no <var>mode</var> 
  argument is supplied, and non-zero otherwise. <br>
  <br>
  Note that when the mode is interpreted as an octal number, each number of the 
  umask is subtracted from <code>7</code>. Thus, a umask of <code>022</code> results 
  in permissions of <code>755</code>. </p>
<p>umask is a bash built in command.<br>
