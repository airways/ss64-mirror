</head><body><h1>basename</h1> 
<p>Strip directory and suffix from filenames</p>
<pre>Syntax
      basename <i>string</i> [<i>suffix</i>]

      basename [-a] [-s <i>suffix</i>] <i>string</i> [...]

      dirname string

Key
   -a   Treat every argument as a string
        (as if basename were invoked with just one argument)

   -s   The suffix is taken as its argument, all other arguments are treated as a string.</pre>
<p> The <span class="code">basename</span> utility deletes any prefix ending with the last slash <span class="code">/</span> character present
in string (after first stripping trailing slashes), and a suffix, if given. The suffix
is not stripped if it is identical to the remaining characters in string. The resulting
filename is written to the standard output.</p>
<p> A non-existent suffix is ignored. </p>
<p>The <span class="code">dirname</span> utility deletes the filename portion, beginning with the last slash `/' character to the end of string (after first stripping trailing slashes), and writes the
result to the standard output.</p>
<p>basename and dirname will exit 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Set the shell variable FOO to /usr/bin</p>
<p class="code"> $ FOO=`dirname /usr/bin/trail`</p>
<p>Set the shell variable FOO$ to the basename of iTunes </p>
<p class="code">$ FOO=`basename /Applications/itunes.app` <br> 
 itunes.app
