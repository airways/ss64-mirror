<pre>Syntax
      let <var>expression</var> [<var>expression</var>]</pre>
<p> Each <var>expression</var> is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated. If the last <var>expression</var> evaluates to 0, <code>let</code> returns 1; otherwise 0 is returned.</p>
<p>let is very similar to <span class="code">((</span> - the only difference being let is a builtin (simple command), and (( is a compound command. </p>
<p>The arguments to let are therefore subject to all the same expansions and substitutions as any other simple command - requiring proper quoting and escaping - whereas the contents of <span class="code">((</span> aren't subject to word-splitting or pathname expansion (almost never desirable for arithmetic).  For this reason, the <a href="syntax-brackets.html#arithmetic">arithmetic compound command</a> should generally be preferred over let. <br>
<br>
`let' is a bash builtin command.</p>
