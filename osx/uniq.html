</head><body><h1>uniq</h1> 
<p>Report or filter out repeated lines in a file. <br>
  Reads standard input comparing adjacent lines, and writes a copy of each unique 
  input line to the standard output. <br>
The second and succeeding copies of identical 
adjacent input lines are not written. </p>
<pre>Syntax
       uniq [-c | -d | -u] [-f <i>fields</i>] [-s <i>chars</i>] [<i>input</i>_<i>file</i> [<i>output</i>_<i>file</i>]]

Options<i>
</i>     <b>-c</b>      Precede each output line with the count of the number of times
             the line occurred in the input, followed by a single space.

     <b>-d</b>      Distinct - Don't output lines that are not repeated in the input.

     <b>-f</b> <i>fields</i>
             Ignore the first <i>fields</i> in each input line when doing compar-
             isons.  A field is a string of non-blank characters separated
             from adjacent fields by blanks.  Field numbers are one based,
             i.e. the first field is field one.

     <b>-s</b> <i>chars</i>
             Ignore the first <i>chars</i> characters in each input line when doing
             comparisons.  If specified in conjunction with the <b>-f</b> option, the
             first <i>chars</i> characters after the first <i>fields</i> fields will be ignored.
             Character numbers are one based, i.e. the first character
             is character one.

     <b>-u</b>      Don't output lines that are repeated in the input.
             Print only lines that are unique in the INPUT.</pre>
<p><b>  </b>By default, <span class="code">uniq</span> prints the unique lines in a sorted file, it 
discards all but one of identical successive input lines. so that the OUTPUT contains unique lines.</p>
<p><span class="code">uniq</span> will only compare lines that appear <i>successively</i> in the input.</p>
<p>Repeated lines in the input will not be 
  detected if they are not adjacent, so it may be necessary to sort the files 
first.</p>
<p>If an <i>InputFile</i> of <span class="code">-</span> (or nothing) is given, then uniq will read from standard input.</p>
<p>If no <i>OutputFile</i> file is specified, <span class="code">uniq</span> writes to standard output.<br>
<br>
The historic +number and -number options have been deprecated 
but are still supported in this implementation.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Count the frequency of some words:</p>
<p class="code">echo &quot;one two three one three&quot; | tr -cs &quot;A-Za-z&quot; &quot;\n&quot;  | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r</p>
