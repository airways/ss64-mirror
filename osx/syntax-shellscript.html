</head><h1>Run a bash shell script</h1>
<p>A shell script is an ASCII text file containing one or more commands.</p>
<p class="code">#!/bin/bash<br>
# My example bash script<br>
echo &quot;Hello World&quot;</p>
<p>The first line contains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29">shebang</a><span class="code"> #!</span> followed by the path to the shell, in this case <span class="code">bash</span> - this acts as an interpreter directive and ensures that the script is executed under the correct shell.</p>
<p>The &quot;#&quot; character indicates a comment, so the shebang line is ignored by bash when running the script.</p>
<p>Next you need to make the script executable with <a href="chmod.html">chmod</a> </p>
<p class="code">$ chmod u+x my_shell_script.sh</p>
<p>You can now run the script by prefixing it with ./ </p>
<p class="code">$ ./my_shell_script.sh</p>
<p>If you get an error like <span class="code">"<i>#!/bin/bash: No such file or directory"</i></span>, that  is typically an indication that the File encoding or line endings are wrong, use an editor like VI or  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> (shows line encodings at the bottom of the edit window) the script file should be <span class="code">Unicode (UTF-8)</span> and <span class="code">Unix (LF)</span> line endings</p>
<p>If you will be writing a few shell scripts then it's worth creating a folder, perhaps called &quot;scripts&quot; and adding that to the system path: </p>
<p class="code">$ mkdir -p $HOME/scripts<br>
$ export PATH=&quot;$PATH:~/scripts&quot;</p>
<p>Even  better is to edit your <span class="code">.bash_profile </span>file to include <span class="code">export PATH=&quot;$PATH:~/scripts&quot;</span> that will keep the &quot;scripts&quot; folder in your path every time you log in.</p>
<p>With the script saved in the folder, you can now run it with just:</p>
<p class="code">$ my_shell_script.sh</p>
