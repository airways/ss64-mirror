</head><body><h1>scselect</h1> 
<p>Switch between network &quot;locations&quot; created in the Network preference pane.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      scselect [-n] [<i>new-location-name</i>]
         
Key
   -n  Delay changing the system's "location" until the next system boot (or
       the next time that the system configuration preferences are changed).

   <i>new-location-name</i>
       If not specified, a list of the available "location" names and associated
       identifiers will be reported on standard output.  If specified, this argument
       is matched with the "location" names and identifiers and the matching set is activated.</pre>
<p>scselect provides access to the system configuration sets, commonly referred to as &quot;locations&quot;.  When invoked with no arguments, scselect displays the names and associated identifiers for each defined &quot;location&quot; and indicates which is currently active.  </p>
<p>scselect also allows the user to select or change the active &quot;location&quot; by specifying its name or identifier.  Changing the &quot;location&quot; causes an immediate system re-configuration, unless the -n option is supplied. </p>
<p>At present, the majority of preferences associated with a &quot;location&quot; relate to the system's network configuration.</p>
