<p> Windows 7 can be configured to print plain text directly to a specified file without prompting for a filename. This is done by adding a value to the Registry and configuring an additional printer port as follows:</p>
<p>1) Locate the following registry key in Regedit:</p>
<p class="code">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Ports</p>
<p>2. From the Edit menu, choose Add Value REG_SZ. In the  Name field type a suitable  path and filename (<span class="code">C:\docs\printout.txt</span>). Leave the value blank.</p>
<p>3. Save your changes and exit Registry Editor.</p>
<p>4. <b>Restart</b> the computer.</p>
<p>5. Start Control Panel, Printers and select an existing printer connection, or add a new one.</p>
<p>6. Choose Printer Properties from the  File menu. For best results configure the printer with the <span class="code">Generic/Text</span> print driver.</p>
<p>7. Under Ports, select the filename  specified in Step 2.</p>
<p>The file can appear without a file extension.<br>
Before sending a second print job the file must be renamed or deleted.</p>
