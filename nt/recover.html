</head><body><h1>RECOVER</h1> 
<p> Recover a damaged file from a defective disk.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      RECOVER [<i>drive</i>:][<i>path</i>]<i>filename</i></pre>
<p> You must specify a <i>filename</i>.</p>
<p>Recover is designed to help in the case of hardware failure. When a drive fails the failure is not always total, you can often read some files but not others, and some files will be only partly 
readable.<br>
<br>
The data on a disk is stored in tracks and sectors in an almost random manner. <br>
<br>
RECOVER reads a file sector by sector and recovers data from the good sectors, data stored in a bad sectors cannot be read so this will often result in a partial recovery with some data loss. Restoring a backup is almost always a better option.<br>
<br>
Recover does not allow you to undelete a file.<br>
