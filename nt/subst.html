<title>Subst - Substitute a drive letter for a network path. | Windows CMD | SS64.com</title>
</head><body><h1>SUBST</h1> 
<p>Substitute a drive letter for a network or local path.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      SUBST <i>drive_letter</i>: <i>path</i>
   
      SUBST 
   
      SUBST <i>drive_letter</i>: /D

Key
   SUBST with no parameters will display current SUBST drives

   /D : Delete the drive_letter substitution.</pre>
<p>The SUBST command can be used to map a drive letter to a LOCAL folder on the same machine. In early versions of Windows SUBST also provided some drive mapping options that are now covered by <a href="net-share.html">NET USE</a>.<br>
<br>
 If the network resource is unavailable (ie the server is down) SUBST will continually 
retry - unlike NET USE which will try to connect once and fail - a subst'd drive that is not 
available will badly impact performance of the computer.</p>
<p>  When SUBST is used against a local shared folder, it will create 
  a RECYCLER for that drive. The RECYCLER is not removed when the drive substitution 
is removed, but can be deleted manually.</p>
<p>Bugs: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/218740">creating</a>, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/246887">accessing</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/258625">deleting</a> drive mappings with SUBST. </p>
<p>Undocumented behaviour: if a drive is substed using characters other than <a href="https://ss64.org/viewtopic.php?id=1599">A-Z</a> ($,#, :, !, 0-9) it will not appear in Windows Explorer or in the drives reported by SUBST.<br>
