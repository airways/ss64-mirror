<title>Waitfor - delay in seconds | Windows CMD | SS64.com</title>
</head><body><h1>WAITFOR.exe (<a href="../links/windows.html#kits">2003 Resource Kit</a>, standard in Windows 7/2008)</h1>
<p> Wait for or send a signal. Waitfor is used to synchronize events between one or more networked computers.</p>
<pre>Syntax
   Wait for a signal:<br>      waitfor [/t <i>Timeout</i>] <i>SignalName</i>

   Send a signal:
      waitfor [/s <i>Computer</i> [/u [<i>Domain</i>\]<i>User</i> [/p [<i>Password</i>]]]] <b>/si</b> <i>SignalName</i>

Key
   /s <i>Computer</i>  The name or IP address of the computer to signal
                (do not include backslashes).

   /u <i>User      </i>Run the script using the credentials of the specified user account.
                By default, waitfor uses the current user's credentials.

   /p [<i>Password</i>] The password of the user account specified with /u

   /si          Send the signal across the network to waiting machines.

   /t <i>Timeout</i>   Number of seconds to wait for a signal.
                The valid range is 1 - 99999 (27.7 hours)
                default = wait indefinitely.

  <i> SignalName</i>   The signal that waitfor waits for or sends.
                SignalName is not case-sensitive.

   /?           Display help.</pre>
<p>Signal names cannot exceed 225 characters. Valid characters include a-z, A-Z, 0-9, the SignalName is not case-sensitive.
<p>If the command line  includes <span class="code">/s <i>Computer</i></span>, the signal will be broadcast  only to the specified system rather than all the computers across the domain. On large domains or wide area networks this <span class="code"></span> will reduce unnecessary network traffic.

<p>To cancel WAITFOR before its timeout has been reached, either launch <span class="code">Waitfor /si <i>signal</i> </span> from a separate command-prompt or <a href="tskill.html">KILL</a> the session.

<p>You can run multiple instances of WAITFOR on a single computer, but each instance must wait for a different signal. Only one instance of WAITFOR can wait for a given signal on a given computer. Computers can only receive signals if they are in the same domain as the computer sending the signal.
<p>Batch scripts including WAITFOR can be run as <a href="schtasks.html">Scheduled</a> tasks under the SYSTEM account. 
<p>Typical WAITFOR applications   include waiting for large ROBOCOPY jobs to complete, restarting services across a cluster/farm, FTP or BITS downloads, compiling software  builds etc.
<p><b>Examples</b>
<p>Wait for 60 seconds or until the &quot;simon&quot; signal is received on the local computer:
<p class="code">C:\&gt; waitfor /t 60  simon </p>
<p>Activate the &quot;simon&quot; signal on the local computer:</p>
<p class="code">C:\&gt; waitfor /s %computername% /si  simon</p>
<p>Wait for 1 hour or until the &quot;backupComplete&quot; signal is received on the local computer:</p>
<p class="code">C:\&gt; waitfor /t 3600 BackupComplete</p>
<p>Activate the &quot;backupComplete&quot; signal on the  computer Server64:</p>
<p class="code">C:\&gt; waitfor /s Server64 /si backupComplete</p>
