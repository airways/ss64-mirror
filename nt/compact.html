<title>Compact - Compress files | Windows CMD | SS64.com</title>
</head><body><h1>COMPACT</h1> 
<p> Display or alter the compression  of files on NTFS partitions.     </p>
<pre>Syntax
      COMPACT [/C | /U] [/S[:<i>dir</i>]] [/A] [ /I] [/F] [/Q] [<i>filename</i> [...]]

Key    
   /C        Compress the specified files.  Directories will be marked
             so that files added afterward will be compressed.

   /U        Uncompress the specified files.  Directories will be marked
             so that files added afterward will not be compressed.

   /S        Perform the specified operation on files in the given
             directory and all subdirectories.  
             Default &quot;dir&quot; is the current directory.

   /A        Display files with the hidden or system attributes. 
             These files are omitted by default.

   /I        Continue performing the specified operation even after errors
             have occurred.  By default, COMPACT will stop when an error is
             encountered.

   /F        Force the compress operation on all specified files, even
             those which are already compressed.  Already-compressed files
             are skipped by default.

   /Q        Report only the most essential information.

   <i>filename</i>  Specifies a pattern, file, or directory.
</pre>
<p> Used without parameters, COMPACT displays the compression state of the current directory and any files it contains.</p>
<p> You can use multiple       filenames and wildcards.  You must put spaces between multiple       parameters.</p>
