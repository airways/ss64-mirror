</head><body><h1>NETSTAT.exe</h1> 
<p>Display current TCP/IP network connections and protocol statistics.</p>
<pre>Syntax
   NETSTAT [<i>options</i>] [-p <i>protocol</i>] [<i>interval</i>]<br>
Key<br>   -a   Display All connections and listening ports.
   -e   Display Ethernet statistics. (may be combined with -s)
   -n   Display addresses and port numbers in Numerical form.
   -r   Display the Routing table.
   -o   Display the Owning process ID associated with each connection.

   -b   Display the exe involved in creating each connection or listening port.<b>*</b>
   -v   Verbose - use in conjunction with -b, to display the sequence of<br>        components involved for all executables.

   -p <i>protocol
      </i>  Show only connections for the protocol specified; 
        can be any of: TCP, UDP, TCPv6 or UDPv6.  
        If used with the -s option then the following protocols
        can also be specified: IP, IPv6, ICMP,or ICMPv6. 

   -s   Display per-protocol statistics.  By default, statistics are
        shown for IP, IPv6, ICMP, ICMPv6, TCP, TCPv6, UDP, and UDPv6;
        (The v6 protocols are not available under 2k and NT4)
        The -p option can be used to display just a subset of these.

   <i>interval</i>     Redisplay statistics, pausing <i>interval </i>seconds between
                each display. (default=once only) Press CTRL+C to stop. </pre>
<p><b>*</b> Where available this will display the sequence of components involved in creating the connection or listening port. (Typically well-known executables which host
multiple independent components.) This option will display the executable name in [ ] at the bottom, with the component it called on top, repeated until TCP/IP is reached. The -b option
can be time-consuming and will fail unless you have sufficient permissions.</p>
