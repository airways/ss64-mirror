</head><body><h1>TAKEOWN</h1> 
<p>Take ownership of a  file (Windows 2003/7/2008).</p>
<pre>Syntax
      TAKEOWN [/s <i>Computer</i> [/u [<i>Domain</i>\]<i>UserName</i> [/p [<i>Password</i>]]]]
         /f <i>FileName</i> [/a] [/r [/d {Y|N}]]<br>
Key
   /s <i>Computer</i>
           The name or IP address of a remote computer (do not use backslashes).
           default = local computer.
           This parameter applies to all of the files and folders specified in the command.

   /u [<i>Domain</i>\]<i>UserName</i>
           Run the script with the permissions of the specified user account.
           default = system permissions.

   /p [<i>Password</i>]
           The password of the user account that is specified in the /u parameter.

   /f <i>FileName</i>
           The file name, UNC path or directory name pattern.
           Accepts the wildcard character *

   /a      Give ownership to the Administrators group instead of the current user.

   /r      Perform a recursive operation on all files in the specified directory
           and subdirectories.

   /d {Y | N}
           Suppress the confirmation prompt that is displayed when the current user
           does not have the "List Folder" permission on a specified directory,
           and instead use a default value:
              Y: Take ownership of the directory.
              N: Skip the directory.
           Note that you must use this option in conjunction with the /r option.</pre>
<p> If the /a parameter is not specified, file ownership is given to the user who is currently logged on to the computer.</p>
<p>Mixed patterns using (? and *) are not supported by the takeown command.</p>
<p>After changing the owner for a file/folder, you can then assign  full permissions to the files  and subsequently read or delete them.</p>
