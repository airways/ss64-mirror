<title>Verify - file copy | Windows CMD | SS64.com</title>
</head><body><h1>VERIFY</h1> 
<p> To check that files are saved to disk correctly; the system can 
re-read the disk after saving to verify that the file is readable.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      VERIFY [ON | OFF]</pre>
<p>By default the CMD shell has verify OFF<br>
</p>
<p>Verify simply checks that the destination file, once written, can be read.
No comparison with the source the files occurs.</p>
<p>Copying files with verify OFF can be significantly faster, up to twice as fast. <br>
<br>VERIFY without a parameter will display the current setting.<br>
</p>
<h2>Errorlevels</h2>
<blockquote>Valid or no parameters given <a href="errorlevel.html">%ERRORLEVEL%</a> = 0<br>
Bad parameters given = 1
</blockquote>
<p>VERIFY is an <a href="syntax-internal.html">internal</a> command.<br>

The most formative years of my life were the first five, and if those years were to be evaluated on the basis of my ability to pass a test on them, the conclusion would be that nothing important happened then, which would be false. <br>
The fact that you can’t remember things doesn’t mean that you haven’t been shaped by them&rdquo; ~ Douglas Wilson, (author of Wordsmithy)</i><br>
