<p>The script below can be used to measure the average IO as a percentage of available bandwidth from the network card(s) of a machine. Similar to the Network information in Task Manager. Where more than one Network interface is fitted, the result will be an average. The script includes a small delay (<a href="start-sleep.html">Start-Sleep</a>) because you probably don't want to hammer a production machine with too many WMI queries.</p>
<pre>

# Measure the Network interface IO over a period of half a minute (0.5)

$startTime = get-date

while ($timeSpan -gt 0)

   # Get an object for the network interfaces, excluding any that are currently disabled.
   $colInterfaces = Get-WmiObject -class Win32_PerfFormattedData_Tcpip_NetworkInterface |select BytesTotalPersec, CurrentBandwidth,PacketsPersec|where {$_.PacketsPersec -gt 0}

   foreach ($interface in $colInterfaces) {
      $bitsPerSec = $interface.BytesTotalPersec * 8
      $totalBits = $interface.CurrentBandwidth

      # Exclude Nulls (any WMI failures)
      if ($totalBits -gt 0) {
         $result = (( $bitsPerSec / $totalBits) * 100)
         Write-Host &quot;Bandwidth utilized:`t $result %&quot;
         $totalBandwidth = $totalBandwidth + $result
         $count++

&ldquo;If you stuff yourself full of poems, essays, plays, stories, novels, films, comic strips, magazines, music, you automatically explode every morning like old faithful. I have never had a dry spell in my life, mainly because I feed myself well, to the point of bursting. I wake early and hear my morning voices leaping around in my head like jumping beans. I get out of bed to trap them before they escape&rdquo; ~ Ray Bradbury</i></p>
