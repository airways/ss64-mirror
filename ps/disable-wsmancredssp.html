<pre>Syntax
      Disable-WSManCredSSP [-Role] <i>string</i> [<i>CommonParameters</i>]

Key
   -Role { Client | Server }<br>       Whether CredSSP should be disabled as a client or as a server.  <br>        <br>       If CredSSP is disabled on the client, the WS-Management setting:
       &lt;localhost|computername&gt;\Client\Auth\CredSSP is set to false.<br>       Also removes any WSMan/* setting from the CredSSP policy AllowFreshCredentials on the client. <br>        <br>       If CredSSP is disabled on the server, the WS-Management setting:
       &lt;localhost|computername&gt;\Service\Auth\CredSSP is set to false.

       -OutBuffer -OutVariable.</pre>
<p> When CredSSP authentication is used, the user's credentials are passed to a remote computer to be authenticated. This type of authentication is designed for commands that create a remote session from within another remote session. For example, running a background job on a remote computer. </p>
