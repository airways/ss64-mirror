<p>Test and repair the secure channel between the local computer and its domain.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      Test-ComputerSecureChannel [-Repair] [-Server <i>string</i>]
         [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<i>CommonParameters</i>]

Key
   -Repair
       Remove and then rebuild the secure channel established by the
       NetLogon service. Use this parameter to try to restore a connection
       that has failed the test (returned &quot;False&quot;.)<br>        <br>       To use this parameter, the current user must be a member of
       the Administrators group on the local computer.<br>        <br>   -Server <i>string
</i>       Use the specified domain controller to run the command.
       If this parameter is omitted, Test-ComputerSecureChannel selects
       a default domain controller for the operation.

   -Confirm
       Prompt for confirmation before executing the command.

   -WhatIf
       Describe what would happen if you executed the command without actually executing it.

   <a href="common.html">CommonParameters</a>:
       -Verbose, -Debug, -ErrorAction, -ErrorVariable, -WarningAction, -WarningVariable,
       -OutBuffer -OutVariable.</pre>
<p>
  Test-ComputerSecureChannel  verifies that the secure channel between the local computer and its domain is
working correctly by checking the status of its trust relationships. If a connection fails, use the -Repair
parameter to try to restore it. <br>
<br>
Test-ComputerSecureChannel returns &quot;True&quot; if the secure channel is working correctly and &quot;False&quot; if it is not. This
result lets you use the cmdlet in conditional statements in functions and scripts. To get more detailed test results, use the <span class="code">-Verbose</span> parameter.<br>
<br>
This cmdlet works much like <a href="../nt/netdom.html">NetDom.exe</a>. Both NetDom and Test-ComputerSecureChannel use the NetLogon service to perform the actions.</p>
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p>Test the secure channel between the local computer and the domain to which it is joined:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:&gt; test-computersecurechannel</span></p>
<p>Use Test-ComputerSecureChannel to test a connection before running a script that requires
the connection:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:&gt; if (!(test-computersecurechannel)) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{write-host &quot;Connection failed. Reconnect and retry.&quot;}<br>
else { &amp;(.\collectserverdata.ps1) }</span></p>
<p>Use <a href="invoke-command.html">Invoke-Command</a> to run a Reset-ComputerMachinePassword command on the Server64 remote computer.</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:&gt; invoke-command -computername Server64 -scriptblock {reset-computermachinepassword}</span></p>
