<p>
  Undo-Transaction  rolls back the active transaction. When a transaction is rolled back , the changes made by  commands within the transaction are discarded and the data is restored to its original form.<br>
<br>
If the transaction includes multiple subscribers, an Undo-Transaction command rolls back the entire transaction for
all subscribers.<br>
<br>
By default, transactions are rolled back automatically if any command in the transaction generates an error. However, transactions can be started with a different rollback preference and you can use this cmdlet to roll back the active transaction at any time. </p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Start a transaction and then roll it back (undo) so that no changes are made:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:\&gt; cd hkcu:\software<br>

PS HKCU:\Software&gt; start-transaction<br>
PS HKCU:\Software&gt; new-item SS64 -usetransaction<br>
PS HKCU:\Software&gt; undo-transaction</span></p>
