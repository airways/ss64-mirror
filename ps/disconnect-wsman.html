</head><body><h1>Disconnect-WSMan</h1> 
<p>Disconnect the client from the WinRM service on a remote computer.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      Disconnect-WSMan [-ComputerName <i>string</i>] [<i>CommonParameters</i>]

Key
   -ComputerName <i>string</i>
       The computer from which you want to disconnect.
       A fully qualified domain name, a Net BIOS name, or an IP address.
       Use the local computer name, localhost, or a dot (.) to specify the local computer.

       The local computer is the default. When the remote computer is in a different domain,
       use a fully qualified domain name. You can pipe a value for ComputerName. 

       Note: You cannot disconnect from the local host, however, if a separate connection
       is made to the local computer (for example, by using the computer name), you can remove
       that connection with Disconnect-WSMan.
