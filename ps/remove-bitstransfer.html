Key
   -BitsJob <i>BitsJob</i>[]

       Pipe a value to this parameter from other cmdlets that return BitsJob objects, such as Get-BitsTransfer.

       -OutBuffer -OutVariable.</pre>
<p>When Remove-BitsTransfer  cancels a BITS transfer job it deletes all the transfers, the underlying transfer job, removes any temporary files from the client, and deletes the associated BitsJob object. In cases where the job is not complete, Remove-BitsTransfer will remove all the transferred files, even those which were completely downloaded. </p>
<p>The <a href="complete-bitstransfer.html">Complete-BitsTransfer</a> cmdlet can be used to commit any files that are completely downloaded and to cancel the pending and current transfers. This method will not delete any of the transferred files.</p>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Cancel all the BITS transfer jobs that are owned by the current user.:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:\&gt; Get-BitsTransfer | Remove-BitsTransfer</span></p>
<p>Cancel all the BITS transfer jobs on the computer:</p>
<p><span class="code">PS C:\&gt; $allJobs = Get-BitsTransfer -AllUsers<br>
PS C:\&gt; Remove-BitsTransfer -BitsJob $allJobs</span></p>
