<pre>Subprocedures:

connection 
          A PL/SQL record type used to represent a TCP/IP connection. 

CRLF      The character sequence carriage-return line-feed. 
          It is the newline sequence commonly used many communication standards. 

open_connection Function 
          Open a TCP/IP connection to a specified service. 

available Function 
          Determine the number of bytes available for reading from a TCP/IP connection. 

read_raw Function 
          Receive binary data from a service on an open connection. 

write_raw Function 
          Transmit a binary message to a service on an open connection. 

read_text Function 
          Receive text data from a service on an open connection. 

write_text Function 
          Transmit a text message to a service on an open connection. 

read_line Function 
          Receive a text line from a service on an open connection.  

write_line Function 
          Transmit a text line to a service on an open connection.  

get_raw(), get_text(), get_line() Functions 
          Convenient forms of the read functions, which return
          the data read instead of the amount of data read. 

flush     Transmit all data in the output buffer, if a buffer is used,
          to the server immediately. 

close_connection
