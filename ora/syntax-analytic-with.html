<body><h1>Analytic Features - WITH clause</h1>
<p> A traditional SQL query can contain more than one SELECT from the same table 
  such as <br>
  SELECT a, sum(b) FROM <b>table_x</b> HAVING sum (b) &gt; (SELECT sum(b) FROM 
  <b>table_x</b>)<br>
  To avoid scanning the table twice, we can define a WITH clause that will SELECT 
  a, sum(b) from table_x.<br>
  <br>
  The WITH clause must be defined <i>before </i>it is used in the query.<br>
  <br>
  WITH clause Syntax:</p>
<pre> <b>  WITH
   <i>name_for_summary_data</i> AS (
     SELECT Statement)</b>
   SELECT <i>columns
</i>   FROM <i>name_for_summary_data</i>
   WHERE <i>conditions</i> &lt;=&gt; (
                      SELECT <i>column
</i>                      FROM <i>name_for_summary_data</i>)
   [ORDER BY <i>columns</i>]</pre>
<p>The WITH clause is resolved internally as either an in-line view or a temporary 
  table (the CBO will choose).<br>
  The <i>name_for_summary_data</i> is visible to all elements of the query and 
  subquery. <br>
  <br>
  Example:<br>
</p>
<pre>  WITH
   MySummary AS (
<b>     SELECT dept_name, Sum(Salary) AS total_sal
     FROM emp, dept
     WHERE emp.dept_id = dept.dept_id
     GROUP BY dept_name</b>)
   SELECT dept_name, total_sal
   FROM MySummary
   WHERE total_sal &gt; (
                      SELECT SUM (total_sal) * 1/12
                      FROM MySummary)
   ORDER BY total_sal</pre>
<p><b>Notes:</b><br>
  The <i>name_for_summary_data</i> can be the same as an existing table name and 
  will take precedence. <br>
