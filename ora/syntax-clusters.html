</head><body><h1>Oracle Syntax -  Clusters and Hash Clusters</h1>
<p>Clusters are groups of one or more tables physically stored together because they share common columns and are often used together. This improves disk access
time.</p>
<p>The related columns of the tables in a cluster are called the <b>cluster key</b>.
The cluster key is indexed so that rows of the cluster can be retrieved with a minimum amount of I/O.</p>
<p>No matter how many  tables within the cluster contain the <b>cluster key </b>value,
it is stored only once each in the cluster and the cluster index. Therefore, less storage is required.</p>
<p>Whether or not a table is part of a cluster is transparent to users and to applications. Data stored in a clustered table is accessed by SQL in the same way as data stored
in a nonclustered table.</p>
<p><b>Hash Clusters</b> cluster table data in a manner similar to normal, index clusters. <br>
<br>
To find or store a row in a hash cluster, Oracle applies a hash function to the row's cluster key value. The resulting hash value corresponds to a data block in the cluster.<br>
All rows with the same key value are stored together on disk.</p>
<p>Hash clusters are a better choice than using an <a href="syntax-tables.html">indexed table</a> or index cluster
when a table is often queried with equality queries (for example, WHERE product_id=123).
For such queries, the specified cluster key value is hashed. The resulting hash key value points directly to the area on disk that stores the rows.</p>
<p>This reduces the amount of I/Os that must be performed to locate and read/write a row of data.<br>
