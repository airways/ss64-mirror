<p>Some <a href="function.html">functions</a> to determine group membership.</p>
<p>You can find an excellent, tried and tested VBScript program to enumerate members of a group<br>
over at hilltop labs - <a href="http://www.rlmueller.net/Programs/EnumGroup2.txt">http://www.rlmueller.net/Programs/EnumGroup2.txt</a></p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>List all members of group64<br>
<br>
<span class="code">cscript //nologo EnumGroup2.vbs &quot;group64&quot;</span></p>
<h2>IsMember</h2>
<p>There are several approaches for checking group membership in VBScript - consider if you need to check Local or Domain groups, and to include or not include nested permissions.</p>
<p> There are also <a href="http://www.rlmueller.net/MemberOf.htm">some gotchas</a> to consider - when enumerating the members of a group it is possible that nothing will be returned, one member is returned or multiple members returned. Test your code with all these possibilities.</p>
<p>Richard mueller has <a href="http://www.rlmueller.net/freecode1.htm">a number of IsMember scripts</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test group membership <a href="http://www.rlmueller.net/Programs/IsMember1.txt">for a single user</a>.</p>
<p>Test group membership (including nested groups)<a href="http://www.rlmueller.net/Programs/IsMember2.txt"> for a single user or computer</a>.<br>
